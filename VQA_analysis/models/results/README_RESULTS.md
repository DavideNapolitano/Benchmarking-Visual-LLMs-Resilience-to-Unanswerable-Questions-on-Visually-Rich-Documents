Inside this folder you find an example of the results structure. Inside the generated dataset folder you can find all the useful scripts.

The scripts include the processing of the metrics and the creation of tables and plots.

As first step, once you created the dataset folder (e.g., results/MPDocVQA), you need to create a folder for each setting (results_w1, results_w1_ocr, ecc...). Inside each of them, you need to create a folder 'original' where you place the linked result files.

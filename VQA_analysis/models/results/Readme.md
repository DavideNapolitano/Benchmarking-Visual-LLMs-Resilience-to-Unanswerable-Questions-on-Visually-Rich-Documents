Inside this folder you find all the scripts to include inside the generate dataset folder (e.g., results/MPDocVQA).

The scripts include the processing of the metrics and the creation of tables and plots.

In the datasets folder (e.g., results/MPDocVQA), you need to create a folder for each setting (results_w1, results_w1_ocr, ecc...).
